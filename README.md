# food-order-takeaway-webapp-UI
so this was created in my very first hackathon. we planned an web-app to solve the food-ordering issues of canteens of our college. 
the basic idea was keeping the webapp simple yet usable and enjoyable.

i've also put up a link of the figma file along with the screenshot. do give it a look and yes feedbacks are always appreciated :)
